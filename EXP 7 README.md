# AIM 
To create array in c++ and doing basic operations on it.

# Software Used
VS Code

# Problem Statement

1.) Write a c++ code to make an array.

2.) Write a c++ code to make an array with elements in reverse order in which user entered.

3.) Write a c++ code to make do sum and average of array elements.

4.) Write a c++ code to find maximum and minimum element of an array.

5.) Write a c++ code to search the position of element, number of time it is occuring in an array.
 
 6.) Write a c++ program to take input from user. 

 7.) Write a c++ program to concatenate the string on c++. 

 8.)  Write a c++ program to reverse string. 

 9.)  Write a c++ program to check a palindrome.

 10.) Write a c++ program to find how many time a letter has occured in a string taken from user.


# Theory
In C++, an array is a data structure that is used to store multiple values of similar data types in a contiguous memory location.

 C++ strings are sequences of characters stored in a char array. Strings are used to store words and text. They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information. Strings in C++ can be defined either using the std::string class or the C-style character arrays.

# Conclusion

We learnt to create an array and operate it. 

We learnt to search element in the array and getting the sum and average of the elements.

We learnt to do concatenation of strings, making and checking palindromes, reversing the string in c++..
