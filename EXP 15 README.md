# AIM
To learn about recursion in c++.

# Problem Statement
1.) Write a c++ program to get factorial of a number using recursion.

2.) Write a c++ program to find fibonacci number in the fibonacci sequence using recursion.

3.) Write a c++ program to find sum of n natural numbers using recursion.

# Theory

Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.


# Output
1.) FACTORIAL

# Conclusion

We learnt to find factorial, fibonacci sequence and sum of 'n' natural numbers using recursion.
