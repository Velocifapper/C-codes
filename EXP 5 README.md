# Problem Statement
1.) Write a c++ program to check if the year is a leap year.
2.) Write a c++ program to validate the password.
3.) Write a c++ program to print days of week.
4.) Write a c++ program to make a simple calculator.
5.) Write a c++ program to evaluate grades.

# Theory
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.

Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.

Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

The switch statement in C++ is a flow control statement that is used to execute the different blocks of statements based on the value of the given expression. We can create different cases for different values of the switch expression. We can specify any number of cases in the switch statement but the case value can only be of type int or char.

# Output
1.) Leap Year
