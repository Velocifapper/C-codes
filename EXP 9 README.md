# AIM
To use pointers and access elements of array and find address of different data types.

# Software Used
VS Code

# Problem Statement

1.) Write a c++ program to initialize pointers of different data types and print the required values.

2.) Write a c++ program to access elements of array using pointer.

3.) Write a c++ program to access elements of array without using pointer variable.

# Theory

Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers. 


# Output

1.) INITIALIZE POINTERS OF DIFFERENT DATA TYPES

   A.) INT

   C.) CHAR

3.) ACCESS ELEMENTS OF ARRAY WITHOUT USING POINTER VARIABLE

# Conclusion

We learnt to initialize pointers of different data types.

We learnt to access elements of array using pointers and without pointers variable.
