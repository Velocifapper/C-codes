# AIM

To learn about inheritance and its type in c++.

# Software Used

VS Code

# Problem Codes

1.) Write a c++ code to do single inheritence.

2.) Write a c++ code to do multiple inheritance.

3.) Write a c++ code to do multilevel inheritance.

4.) Write a c++ code to do hierarchical inheritance.

# Theory

The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object Oriented Programming in C++. In this article, we will learn about inheritance in C++, its modes and types along with the information about how it affects different properties of the class.


# Output

1.) SINGLE INHERITANCE

# Conclusion

We learnt to do multiple inheritance, single inheritance, multilevel and heirerichal inheritance.
