#  Theory
In C++, for loop is an entry-controlled loop that is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for the specified range of values. Basically, for loop allows you to repeat a set of instructions for a specific number of iterations.

While Loop in C++ is used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of the loop beforehand. The loop execution is terminated on the basis of the test condition. Loops in C++ come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements.

Floyd's triangle is a triangular array of natural numbers used in computer science education. It is named after Robert Floyd. It is defined by filling the rows of the triangle with consecutive numbers, starting with a 1 in the top left corner
