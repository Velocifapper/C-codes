# AIM
To learn about different data types and their size and demonstration of storage classes.

# Software Used
VS Code

# Problem Statement
1.) Write a program to show size of different data types.

2.) Write a program for static class.

# Theory
 
| Data type  | Size (bytes) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|int	  | 4  |
| float  | 4 |
|string| 24 |
|char| 1 |
|short int| 2|

 _'size of'_ function is used to get the size of data type.


## Output

## Conclusion

1. We learnt to use _'size of'_ function & static class.

2. We learnt about different data types and their use.
